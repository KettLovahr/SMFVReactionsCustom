[size=12pt][u][b]About Mod:[/b][/u][/size]

This mod adds animated reaction emojis/smileys below every post of a topic. It allows users to show their reaction towards the post by clicking the emoji. By hovering over the emoji, you can view the list of users who have reacted to the post with selected reaction. Reaction count is also displayed alongside each emoji separately.
